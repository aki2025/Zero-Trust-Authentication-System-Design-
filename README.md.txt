4. Based on risk score, additional authentication factors may be required
5. Session token issued with embedded risk parameters

### 3.2 Continuous Monitoring
1. Behavioral data collected every 30 seconds
2. Real-time analysis of user patterns
3. Continuous updates to risk score
4. Automatic session adjustment based on risk changes
