    }
}
```

#### B. Model Ensemble Architecture

   - Architecture:
     - Input Layer: 128 nodes
     - LSTM Layers: 2 layers, 64 nodes each
     - Dense Layers: 32 nodes, 16 nodes
     - Output Layer: Binary classification
   - Sequence Length: 50 time steps
   - Features: Time-series behavioral data

3. **Isolation Forest**
   - Purpose: Anomaly detection
   - Contamination Factor: 0.1
   - Features: High-dimensional behavior vectors
   - Output: Anomaly scores (-1 to 1)

### 1.2 Risk Scoring Engine

#### A. Feature Components
```python
Risk_Score = {
    'Behavioral_Risk': {
        'Weight': 0.4,
        'Components': [
            'RF_Classification_Score',
            'LSTM_Sequence_Score',
            'Isolation_Forest_Score'
        ]
    },
    'Contextual_Risk': {
        'Weight': 0.3,
        'Components': [
            'Location_Score',
            'Device_Score',
            'Network_Score'
        ]
    },
    'Historical_Risk': {
        'Weight': 0.3,
        'Components': [
            'Past_Incidents',
            'Access_Patterns',
            'Time_Patterns'
        ]
    }
}
```

#### B. Scoring Algorithm
1. Each component produces a score (0-1)
2. Weighted average calculated
3. Exponential scaling applied
4. Final score normalized to 0-100

## 2. Use Cases and System Behavior

### 2.1 Normal Login Scenario
```plaintext
Scenario: Employee logging in from regular office location
```
**System Response:**
1. Collects initial credentials
2. Gathers context (IP, device, time)
3. Initial Risk Score: 25 (Low)
   - Location matches history (+)
   - Device recognized (+)
   - Time within normal pattern (+)
4. Requires: Standard 2FA only
5. Session established with 30-min re-verification

### 2.2 Suspicious Login Detection
```plaintext
Scenario: Login attempt from new location with unusual timing
```
**System Response:**
1. Initial authentication succeeds
2. Context triggers alerts:
   - Unknown location (Risk +20)
   - Unusual time (Risk +15)
   - New device (Risk +10)
3. Final Risk Score: 75 (High)
4. Actions Triggered:
   - Step-up authentication required
   - Admin notification
   - Session logging increased
   - Resource access limited

### 2.3 Behavioral Anomaly Detection
```plaintext
Scenario: Legitimate user exhibiting unusual behavior patterns
```
**System Response:**
1. Normal session in progress
2. Behavioral changes detected:
   - Unusual command sequences
   - Different typing patterns
   - Abnormal navigation
3. ML Models Response:
   - RF Score drops to 0.6
   - LSTM detects pattern deviation
   - Isolation Forest score: -0.5
4. Actions:
   - Risk score increases incrementally
   - Additional verification at resource access
   - Session timeout reduced
   - Behavioral logging increased

### 2.4 Potential Account Compromise
```plaintext
Scenario: Multiple suspicious indicators during session
```
**System Response:**
1. Multiple risk factors accumulate:
   - Behavioral mismatch
   - Unusual data access
   - Suspicious network activity
2. ML Analysis:
   - Ensemble model confidence < 0.3
   - Anomaly score > 0.8
3. Actions Triggered:
   - Session suspended
   - Admin alert generated
   - Audit log marked
   - User notification sent
   - Step-up auth required for continuation

### 2.5 Progressive Authentication
```plaintext
Scenario: User accessing increasingly sensitive resources
```
**System Response:**
1. Initial access granted to basic resources
2. As user requests more sensitive data:
   - Risk score recalculated
   - Resource sensitivity evaluated
   - User behavior analyzed
3. Progressive Requirements:
   - Level 1: Basic auth
   - Level 2: Additional factor
   - Level 3: Biometric verification
   - Level 4: Admin approval

## 3. Model Training and Updates

### 3.1 Training Pipeline
1. Weekly data collection
2. Feature extraction
3. Model retraining
4. Performance evaluation
5. Gradual deployment

### 3.2 Update Triggers
- Significant behavior changes
- New attack patterns
- False positive rate increase
- User feedback
- Security incidents
